If you have ever read the comments of a recipe online, especially on [allrecipes.com](http://allrecipes.com), you may have noticed the prevalence of the words "hubby" and "yummy" in the comments. To me, these words are worse than nails on a chalkboard, and reading these comments often gives the impression that all "hubbies" are "soooo picky". But I digress.

However, one evening while my quiche was taking longer than expected to firm up, I got curious: could we quantify which recipes were the most "yummy" *cringe* or best for the "hubby" *more cringing*.

Below you will find the 50 recipes with the most occurrences of "hubby" and "yummy" from [thepioneerwoman.com](http://thepioneerwoman.com).
